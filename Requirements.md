## Vision
The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) is designed to automate and simplify the management of employee vacation and leave requests within an organization. Traditionally, this process was entirely manual and paper-based, requiring HR staff to verify available leave balances and managers to review and approve each request. This often resulted in unnecessary delays, redundant approvals, and a heavy administrative workload.

The new VTS provides a modern, web-based solution that allows employees to view their vacation history for the previous six months and plan future requests up to 18 months ahead. The system enables managers to review and approve requests directly, while HR retains control over leave balances and policy rules without being involved in every individual transaction.

By implementing a flexible, rules-based validation engine, the system ensures accuracy, consistency, and fairness in managing leave requests. Additionally, automated email notifications, audit logs, and seamless integration with the company’s intranet and HR legacy systems enhance efficiency and transparency.

Ultimately, the vision of the Vacation Tracking System is to empower employees, reduce HR overhead, and streamline organizational workflows through an intuitive, secure, and easy-to-use platform.
